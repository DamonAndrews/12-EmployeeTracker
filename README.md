SQL Challenge: Employee Tracker
Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called content management systems (CMS). Your assignment this module is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to create a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality and all of the following acceptance criteria being met. You’ll need to submit a link to the video and add it to the README of your project.

This is an Employee Tracker that provides the user a variety of functions for a company database. Upon launching, the user is presented with a list of actions including viewing roles, adding employees, updating employees, and more!

Simply follow the on screen commands, and when done, just select All Set! to exit.
